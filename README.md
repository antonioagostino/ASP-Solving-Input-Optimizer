# ASP Solving Input Optimizer

A tool that **makes optimizations** to an input for an *ASP Solver*, like *CLASP* or *WASP*, before the solver reads this input file.  It, now, supports an input format called *"aspif"*, so it makes transformations to a file written using this format and creates a new, **optimized**, input encoded file.
